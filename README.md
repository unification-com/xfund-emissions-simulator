# xFUND Emissions Simulator

This repo contains a simulation for xFUND emissions. The underlying algorithm used
for calculating daily xFUND emission allocations in this simulation is identical
to the algorithm used in the live [xFUND](https://xfund.unification.io) deployment

A version of this simulator is also running on
[https://unification.io/xfund_emulator/](https://unification.io/xfund_emulator)

## Running

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```
or
```bash

```

2. Run:

```bash
