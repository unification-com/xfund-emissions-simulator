<h1>xFUND Emissions Algorithm Simulator</h1>

<h2>1. Calculating Allocation Entries</h2>

<p>
    At the point of running, the validator set is acquired from
    <a href="https://rest.unification.io/staking/validators?limit=100" target="_blank">
        https://rest.unification.io/staking/validators?limit=100
    </a>. For the purposes of this simulation, it is refreshed when the page is reloaded, not when the "Run Simulation"
    button is clicked.
</p>

<p>
    The Validators' stake (self-delegated and delegated) is used to calculate their proportion of
    the total ACTIVE network stake as a %. Delegations to inactive or jailed nodes do not count, and
    jailed/inactive nodes are not included in the allocations.
</p>

<p>
    The proportional value is multiplied by <strong><span id="entry_multiplier"></span></strong>
    and rounded to give the "number of entries", with any validators resulting in zero, defaulting to
    <strong><span id="default_for_zero"></span></strong> entry. The number of entries are for each of the 24 draws, with each draw being
    mutually exclusive of one another (i.e. a validator has the same chance of being allocated xFUND in draw #4 as they do draw #19).
</p>

<table cellspacing="10">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Validator</th>
        <th>Token Stake</th>
        <th>Stake Proportion</th>
        <th># Entries</th>
        <th>Allocation Probability</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody id="emissions_body">

    </tbody>
</table>

<h2>2. Running the Emissions</h2>

<p>
    An array containing <strong><span id="total_entries"></span></strong> entries is generated,
    with each validitor being allocated their number of entries as per the table above. For example:
</p>

<pre>
    entries[0] = BerlinFUNDCrew
    entries[1] = BerlinFUNDCrew
    entries[2] = BerlinFUNDCrew
    entries[3] = BerlinFUNDCrew
    entries[4] = BerlinFUNDCrew
    entries[5] = ClanFund
    entries[6] = ClanFund
    entries[7] = Serenity
    entries[8] = Serenity
    entries[9] = Serenity
    ...
    entries[8976] = xSigma
    entries[8977] = xSigma
    entries[8978] = xSigma
    entries[8979] = FUNDThailand
    etc.
</pre>

<p>
    For each of the 24 emissions, the entries array is shuffled to randomise the ordering, and a random number
    between <strong>0 and <span id="total_entries1"></span></strong> is generated. This random bumber is used
    as the array ID to select which validator the emission is allocated to.
